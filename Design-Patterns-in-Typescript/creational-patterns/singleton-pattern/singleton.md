**Singleton Pattern**

The Singleton Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across a system.

**The Singleton Pattern involves the following:**

*Private Constructor:*  The constructor of the class is marked private to prevent other classes from creating new instances using the new keyword.

*Static Instance:*  A static property that holds the single instance of the class, ensuring that only one instance exists.

*Static 'getInstance' Method:*  This method checks if the instance property is null. If it is, it creates a new instance of the class and assigns it to the instance property. If an instance already exists, it simply returns that instance.

*Public Static Method:* Provides a way to access the instance, creating it if it doesn't exist.

The *getInstance* method is used to get the single instance of the class. Any number of calls to getInstance will return the same instance.

Call Logger.getInstance() to get the single instance and use its methods.

Let's create a Logger class that follows the Singleton Pattern. This logger will have a method to log messages, and we'll ensure there's only one instance of it throughout the application.

This pattern ensures that there is only one instance of the Logger class, providing a global point of access to it.
