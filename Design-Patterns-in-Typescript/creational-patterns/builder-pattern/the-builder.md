**The Builder Pattern**

The Builder pattern is a design pattern that allows you to create complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

This is the complex object that we want to build. In this case, it's a House.

*House Class:*

- Represents the complex object to be built.
- Has methods to set its properties.
- Defines the steps required to build a house.
