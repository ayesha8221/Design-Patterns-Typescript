**The Factory Pattern**

The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern is useful when the exact type of the object to be created isn't known until runtime.

Let's consider an example where we have different types of animals (Horse and Rabbit), and we want to use a factory to create these animals.

- Define an interface that all product types should implement. In this case, it's Animal.
- Implement the Animal interface in concrete classes.
- The factory class will have a method to create animals based on the type provided.
- Use the factory to create instances of Dog and Cat.

The factory pattern encapsulates the object creation logic, making it easy to add new types of animals without changing the client code that uses the factory.
