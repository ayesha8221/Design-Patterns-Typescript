**Facade Pattern**

The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use. It hides the complexities of the system and provides a single, unified interface.

*Facade:* The simplified interface that interacts with the complex subsystem.
*Subsystem:* The complex set of classes, methods, and processes that the facade simplifies.
