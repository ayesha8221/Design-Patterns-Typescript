**The Bridge Pattern**

The Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that separates an objectâ€™s abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. This pattern involves an interface that acts as a bridge which makes the functionality of concrete classes independent from interface implementer classes.

Let's create a simple example where we have shapes (abstraction) and different ways to draw them (implementation). 
Draw 2 different circles (radius, x and y)
